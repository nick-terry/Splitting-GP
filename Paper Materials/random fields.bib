	abstract = {This chapter deals with the main concepts and mathematical tools that help to describe and quantify the shapes of random fields. The geometry of Gaussian random functions is to a large extent determined by the mean and the two-point correlation functions. The classical text on the geometry of random fields is the book written by Robert Adler [10]. The basic elements of random field geometry are contained in the technical report by Abrahamsen [3]. A more recent and mathematically advanced book by Taylor and Adler exposes the geometry of random field using the language of manifolds [11].},
